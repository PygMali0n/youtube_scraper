As the company's only RWD car, its bespoke chassis, high-revving engine, and near perfect 50/50 weight distribution made it a huge hit for enthusiasts looking for an entry-level sports car with a big tuning potential. For 2022, the long-awaited second generation #BRZ is here, it gets a new 2.4L NA F-4 with up to 228 HP and 184 lb-ft of torque. Subaru has also given the BRZ a new design inside and out and when it goes on sale next Fall, pricing shouldn't stray too far from the current models under $30k base price."

It had proven that they are growing as a global influence with 8 albums entering into the Billboard along with ‘Artist 100’  On the third day of the album's release, it broke its record including ranking number one in 49 countries on the iTunes Album Chart, ranking number one worldwide for three consecutive days, and also entering the ‘Rolling Stone Top 200’ Chart for two consecutive weeks, as well as entering the Top 100 on the Official Album Download Chart, which is an official chart in the UK. After successfully completing the promotions of “Why Not?” which is the title track of [12:00] album, LOONA released the official music video and concept photos of Star, the English version of Voice in response to the support they receive globally.  Even though Voice and Star are the same songs, Korean version and the English version consist of lyrics of two different stories and charms. Star is an energetic retro song with a low, addictive repeated beat. Inspired by the Midnight Festival, Sleeping Beauty, and space, “Star” music video tells the story of waking up in a dream and pursuing goals and inspiration after discovering themselves in a mysterious space.

So, let’s discuss what we know about the 2022 Honda Civic…ehem…prototype. Item 1, let’s talk about style. The first impression is this baby looks all growsed up.This new Civic, while it’s not, looks lower and wider thanks in part to a thinned out A-pillar that’s been pushed back two inches, a simplifying of the sheet metal, no crazy origami creasing here, folks, and a built-in spoiler.  The Civic moves away from its bold and unique design language from generation 10, but I’m wondering if it’s too far a move that the younger demographic who Honda claims traditionally buys this compact wonder will find it too sedate. One of the 10th generation Civic’s great strengths was an interior far roomier than its compact car label would imply. How does the interior of the all-new Civic stack up? I would tell you if this car had an interior. All we have to go on right now is this picture of the interior but that horizontal vent element looks pretty cool, right? What we do know is that interior space will be just as generous as the current Civic and, thanks to a longer wheelbase, the rear seatbacks should offer a bit more recline. Also, there will be a 9-inch Infotainment screen, a digital gauge cluster will be available, outward visibility will improve for the driver due to A-pillars that moved rearward a couple of inches, and there will most definitely be a volume knob.OK, you’re probably wondering about stuff like engine choices, the transmission, and other mechanical details. Here’s what we know.We know nothing. Ok, almost nothing. We know this will ride on the same architecture as the current generation Civic, but with significant upgrades including greater torsional rigidity for improved handling. We’ve heard it will drive better, which for the Civic, especially variants like the Type R sounds very exciting. We’re not sure about engine options, but expect an automatic transmission on the sedan, with a manual option for the Si, hatchback, and Type R enthusiasts. Of course, as a concerned parent, my brain is constantly obsessing about vehicle safety. Will the 2022 Civic be safe?Great question, on-camera Micah. Until the NHTSA crashes this thing, we won’t know for sure but Honda says the Civic’s stronger body structure will crash better and the Honda Sensing suite of active safety assists will be standard, decreasing the likelihood of a crash in the first place. If you’re wondering about Civic variants, no fear. There will be a sedan and a hatchback, though the coupe has sadly gone to that big junkyard in the sky.  But soothing the pain of the coupe’s departure is the return of the Civic Si and Civic Type R, which Honda PR annoyingly will not show us. Based on vague first impressions the 11th generation Civic looks very promising. Good thing, because even though SUVs are hugely popular. Some of us still like cars. If all of this looks enticing, you’ll have the chance to buy the 2022 Honda Civic sedan in the late spring of 2021.  Sometime after that, the civic hatch, the Si, and the Type R will arrive. Now if you’ll excuse us we’re going to impotently harass the Honda PR team for an early look."

However, Harden is still under contract until at least 2022, so Houston has no incentive to take any bad deal in exchange for the former MVP.

It took us a while to figure it out, but luckily, Professor was talking back to the kittens on the YouTube video I was playing on my phone.If you would like to adopt this cute little kitten, please contact our friends at Guardian Angel Pet Rescue: https://guardianangelpets.comThe dog in the video is Loreto.  He was rescued by our main surgeon, Dr. Antonio Pedraza.  Loreto had two broken legs, and they are now both fixed!  I will post before and after pictures on our FB and IG.If you would like to adopt Loreto (not to be confused with our Loreta), please fill an adoption application on our website: https://www.HopeForPaws.orgThank you so much!Eldad#HopeForPaws #KittenRescue #Kitten"

After he was brought onshore, emergency responders administered first aid to him for 20 minutes before loading him into an ambulance.The weather forecast had been calling for strong winds, which drew the surfers to the beach, but then the storm hit with unexpected speed and force.

We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international travels. We cannot wait to have a place to call our own!! After 4 weeks up here we are really settling into the slow pace of life and the peace and quiet. And this week we tackle two projects that CHANGE EVERYTHING for us up here!!! 🌲  Looking forward to all of the home renovations and cabin improvements we'll be tackling this winter!Catch up on our cabin in the woods videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZJRuafNYdPweo6S8x6hvPZowmbLrkFM7Eamon & Bec Products↠ handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ ↞↠ cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups ↞↠ professional photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets ↞↠ van build guide https://www.eamonandbec.com/vanbuild ↞How Did We Get Here?Abandoning our Van in Africa  https://bit.ly/2Kff0HTAfter an incredible 3 years of living, working, and traveling in our self converted Sprinter Van we made the very tough decision to abandon it in Africa to take a rescue flight back to Canada.  As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

Our goal here is to inspire you to chase after your own dreams however big (or small... tiny homes anyone?) they may be! We hope to create a community of like-minded, positive individuals who will grow to love and support one another on their own journeys."

Learn everything you need to know about the new series and how it was made in this video. As the 1970s are drawing to a close, Queen Elizabeth and her family find themselves preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor), who is still unmarried at 30. As the nation begins to feel the impact of divisive policies introduced by Britain's first female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, tensions arise between her and the Queen which only grow worse as Thatcher leads the country into the Falklands War, generating conflict within the Commonwealth. While Charles’ romance with a young Lady Diana Spencer provides a much-needed fairytale to unite the British people, behind closed doors, the Royal family is becoming increasingly divided.➡️SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE: http://bit.ly/29kBByrAbout Netflix:Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 195 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.

It was uneventful but eventful at the same time. More chaos than food fight if I'm honest. But you probably already know that because who reads the description before watching the video am I right.It was a bad time because we got punished in an intense way, but it was also a good time because it was really crazy to be a part of.

I hope you like it too!Oh also I am starting another channel to put my short animations on. Usually I post them to tiktok or instagram or twitter but I think putting them on youtube.

Jackery is celebrating its 8th anniversary and its official website is on 15% off of all products for 3 days! Check their website: https://www.jackery.com/pages/jackery-8th-anniversary?aff=27In this weeks episode we visit Nicola and Arron, a dynamic young couple who have some big dreams for the future, that have been made possible thanks to a tiny house. So many young people have given up on the idea that they will ever be able to own their own home. In cities like Auckland, where the average house price is over 1 million dollars and climbing fast, many see their dreams of home ownership moving further from reality. Thankfully, with a little creative thinking, there are still ways to get started on the housing ladder and this innovative young couple decided to get out of the rent trap by purchasing a pre-loved tiny house so they could start paying off their own home and begin saving money to purchase land. Their tiny home is incredibly clever in its design. It’s spacious, with more than enough room for the couple and with an abundance of storage. Throughout the home there are super clever design features, such as the innovative office loft, and ultra clever pull-out stairs. The entire centre floor of this home opens up into an abundance of additional storage space, and dual french doors ensure the home has an abundance of light and connection to the outdoors. Nicola and Arron have big dreams for their future and plan on one day living on a stunning sustainable property surrounded by fruit trees. Every month they purchase a new fruit tree together a a reminder of the dreams they share and the goals they are working towards. This tiny house is an essential part of that, as they are now able to live in their own home which will soon be paid off and enable them to begin saving for land. Enjoy the video tour of this very special home!
